In ACM Transactions on Graphics, vol. 35, num. 2, 2016. Presented at SIGGRAPH 2016.#ABSTRACT#In this article, we present a parallel prioritized Jacobian-based inverse kinematics algorithm for multithreaded architectures. We solve damped least squares inverse kinematics using a parallel line search by identifying and sampling critical input parameters. Parallel competing execution paths are spawned for each parameter in order to select the optimum that minimizes the error criteria. Our algorithm is highly scalable and can handle complex articulated bodies at interactive frame rates. We show results on complex skeletons consisting of more than 600 degrees of freedom while being controlled using multiple end effectors. We implement the algorithm both on multicore and GPU architectures and demonstrate how the GPU can further exploit fine-grain parallelism not directly available on a multicore processor. Our implementations are 10 to 150 times faster compared to a state-of-the-art serial implementation while providing higher accuracy. We also demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm over multiple scenarios and explore the GPU implementation in detail.

Computers \u0026amp; Graphics, 2016.#ABSTRACT#In this paper we present an intuitive tool suitable for 2D artists using touch-enabled pen tablets. An artist-oriented tool should be easy-to-use, real-time, versatile, and locally refinable. Our approach uses an interactive system for 3D character posing from 2D strokes. We employ a closed-form solution for the 2D strokes to 3D skeleton registration problem. We first construct an intermediate 2D stroke representation by extracting local features using meaningful heuristics. Then, we match 2D stroke segments to 3D bones. Finally, 3D bones are carefully realigned with the matched 2D stroke segments while enforcing important constraints such as bone rigidity and depth. Our technique is real-time and has a linear time complexity. It is versatile, as it works with any type of 2D stroke and 3D skeleton input. Finally, thanks to its coarse-to-fine design, it allows users to perform local refinements and thus keep full control over the final results. We demonstrate that our system is suitable for 2D artists using touch-enabled pen tablets by posing 3D characters with heterogeneous topologies (bipeds, quadrupeds, hands) in real-time.

Journal of Sports Sciences, 2012.#ABSTRACT#We propose a new method, based on inertial sensors, to automatically measure at high frequency the durations of the main phases of ski jumping (i.e. take-off release, take-off, and early flight). The kinematics of the ski jumping movement were recorded by four inertial sensors, attached to the thigh and shank of junior athletes, for 40 jumps performed during indoor conditions and 36 jumps in field conditions. An algorithm was designed to detect temporal events from the recorded signals and to estimate the duration of each phase. These durations were evaluated against a reference camera-based motion capture system and by trainers conducting video observations. The precision for the take-off release and take-off durations (indoor \u0026lt;39 ms, outdoor = 27 ms) can be considered technically valid for performance assessment. The errors for early flight duration (indoor = 22 ms, outdoor = 119 ms) were comparable to the trainers\u0026rsquo; variability and should be interpreted with caution. No significant changes in the error were noted between indoor and outdoor conditions, and individual jumping technique did not influence the error of take-off release and take-off. Therefore, the proposed system can provide valuable information for performance evaluation of ski jumpers during training sessions.

Graphical Models, Selected papers from SCA, 2006.#ABSTRACT#In this paper, we present an interactive motion deformation method to modify animations so that they satisfy a set of prioritized constraints. Our approach successfully handles the problem of retargeting and adjusting a motion, as well as adding significant changes to preexisting animations. We introduce the concept of prioritized constraints for motion editing by exploiting an arbitrary large number of priority-layers. Each frame is individually and smoothly adjusted to enforce a set of prioritized constraints. The iterative construction of the solution channels the convergence through intermediate solutions, enforcing the highest prioritized constraints first. In addition, we propose a new, simple formulation to control the position of the center of mass so that the resulting motions are physically plausible. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can address a wide range of motion editing problems.

In Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation, 2006.#ABSTRACT#Motion capture data is now widely available to create realistic character animation. However, it is difficult to reuse without any additional information. For this reason, annotating motion data with kinematic constraints is a clever step to ease further operations such as blending or motion editing. Unfortunately, prior automatic methods prove to be unreliable for noisy data and/or lack genericity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting kinematic constraints for motion data. It detects when an object (or an end-effector) is stationary in space or is rotating around an axis or a point. Our method is fast, generic and may be used on any kind of objects in the scene. Furthermore, it is robust to highly noisy data as we detect and reject aberrant data by using a least median of squares (LMedS) method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method in various motion editing contexts.

In computer games for example, virtual humans often are the main characters. Failing to realistically animate them may wreck all previous efforts made to provide the player with an immersion feeling. At the same time, computer generated movies have become very popular and thus have increased the demand for animation realism. Indeed, virtual humans are now the new stars in movies like Final Fantasy or Shrek, or are even used for special effects in movies like Matrix. In this context, Virtual human animations not only need to be realistic as for computer games, but really need to be expressive as for real actors. While creating animations from scratch is still widespread, it demands artistic skills and hours if not days to produce few seconds of animation. For these reasons, there has been a growing interest for motion capture: instead of creating a motion, the idea is to reproduce the movements of a live performer. However, motion capture is not perfect and still needs improvements. Indeed, the motion capture process involves complex techniques and equipments. This often results in noisy animations which must be edited. Moreover, it is hard to exactly foresee the final motion. For example, it often happens that the director of a movie decides to change the script. The animators then have to change part or the whole animation. The aim of this thesis is then to provide animators with interactive tools helping them to easily and rapidly modify preexisting animations. We first present our IK solver used to enforce kinematic constraints at each time of an animation. Afterward, we propose a motion deformation framework offering the user a way to specify prioritized constraints and to edit an initial animation so that it may be used in a new context (characters, environment,etc). Finally, we introduce a semi-automatic algorithm to extract important motion features from motion capture animation which may serve as a first guess for the animators when specifying important characteristics an initial animation should respect.
