      <description>Parallel Inverse Kinematics for Multithreaded Architectures#Pawan Kumar Harish, Mentar Mahmudi, Benoit Le Callennec, Ronan Boulic. In ACM Transactions on Graphics, vol. 35, num. 2, 2016. Presented at SIGGRAPH 2016.#ABSTRACT#In this article, we present a parallel prioritized Jacobian-based inverse kinematics algorithm for multithreaded architectures. We solve damped least squares inverse kinematics using a parallel line search by identifying and sampling critical input parameters. Parallel competing execution paths are spawned for each parameter in order to select the optimum that minimizes the error criteria.</description>

      <description>Artist-Oriented 3D Character Posing from 2D Strokes#Mentar Mahmudi, Pawan Kumar Harish, Benoit Le Callennec, Ronan Boulic. Computers &amp;amp; Graphics, 2016.#ABSTRACT#In this paper we present an intuitive tool suitable for 2D artists using touch-enabled pen tablets. An artist-oriented tool should be easy-to-use, real-time, versatile, and locally refinable. Our approach uses an interactive system for 3D character posing from 2D strokes. We employ a closed-form solution for the 2D strokes to 3D skeleton registration problem.</description>

      <description>Mosketch#Quick and easy 3D character animation#ABSTRACT#Mosketch® is a 3D animation software that allows artists to animate any 3D characters by the stroke of a pen. It is intuitive and cuts production times by 4 on average. With Mosketch, users can animate any 3D character using joints only. Complex control rigs are not needed anymore! Sketch on your 3D character joints to quickly design key poses.</description>

      <description>Automatic measurement of key ski jumping phases and temporal events with a wearable system#Julien Chardonnens, Julien Favre, Benoit Le Callennec, Florian Cuendet, Gérald Gremion, Kamiar Aminian. Journal of Sports Sciences, 2012.#ABSTRACT#We propose a new method, based on inertial sensors, to automatically measure at high frequency the durations of the main phases of ski jumping (i.e. take-off release, take-off, and early flight). The kinematics of the ski jumping movement were recorded by four inertial sensors, attached to the thigh and shank of junior athletes, for 40 jumps performed during indoor conditions and 36 jumps in field conditions.</description>

      <description>Interactive motion deformation with prioritized constraints#Benoit Le Callennec, Ronan Boulic. Graphical Models, Selected papers from SCA, 2006.#ABSTRACT#In this paper, we present an interactive motion deformation method to modify animations so that they satisfy a set of prioritized constraints. Our approach successfully handles the problem of retargeting and adjusting a motion, as well as adding significant changes to preexisting animations. We introduce the concept of prioritized constraints for motion editing by exploiting an arbitrary large number of priority-layers.</description>

      <description>Robust Kinematic Constraint Detection for Motion Data#Benoit Le Callennec, Ronan Boulic. In Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation, 2006.#ABSTRACT#Motion capture data is now widely available to create realistic character animation. However, it is difficult to reuse without any additional information. For this reason, annotating motion data with kinematic constraints is a clever step to ease further operations such as blending or motion editing.</description>

      <description>Interactive Techniques For Motion Deformation Of Articulated Figures Using Prioritized Constraints#Benoit Le Callennec. PhD Thesis, 2006.#ABSTRACT#Convincingly animating virtual humans has become of great interest in many fields since recent years. In computer games for example, virtual humans often are the main characters. Failing to realistically animate them may wreck all previous efforts made to provide the player with an immersion feeling. At the same time, computer generated movies have become very popular and thus have increased the demand for animation realism.</description>

      <description>This post summarizes some interesting facts mentionned in an interview given by Renee Tam from Pixar at Foundry (October, 25th 2017) 1.
Coco movie 2 contains:
8.7 millions lights 27 millions objects 1 billions assets The most challenging scenes required up to 450 hours of rendering per frame.
By implementing some optimization techniques, in particular by pre-processing some backgrounds areas, they were able to accelerate rendering time to 55 hours per frame.</description>

      <description>This article summarizes the most interesting points made in the following video:
75% of images in IKEA&amp;rsquo;s are in fact photorealistic CG images (and no photographs).
CG offers greater flexibility. They most importantly allow to visualize objetcts that do not exist yet.
There are 4 fundamental elements that must be of the utmost quality to generate realistic CG images: modeling, materials, illumination and post-processing.
The most time-consuming domains are materials and illumination.</description>
